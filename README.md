All the projects in python done as part of FCC curriculum

## Arithmetic Formatter:
Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.

## Time Calculator:
Write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:
  a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
  a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
  (optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive
  The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result.

## Budget App:
Complete the Category class in budget.py. It should be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. When objects are created, they are passed in the name of the category.

## Polygon Area Calculator:
A project using object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.

## Probability Calculator:
Suppose there is a hat containing 5 blue balls, 4 red balls, and 2 green balls. What is the probability that a random draw of 4 balls will contain at least 1 red ball and 2 green balls? While it would be possible to calculate the probability using advanced mathematics, an easier way is to write a program to perform a large number of experiments to estimate an approximate probability.
